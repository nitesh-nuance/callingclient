# Fix for Azure Communication Services SDK Event Subscription Error

## Error Details
```
CallingCommunicationError: Not able to subscribe to Call event, unknown event name.
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the code was trying to subscribe to a `callEnded` event that doesn't exist in the Azure Communication Services Calling SDK for JavaScript.

## Solution Applied

### Issue 1: Invalid `callEnded` Event
**Problem**: The code was using `callEnded` event which is not a valid event in the ACS JavaScript SDK.

**Fix**: Replaced `callEnded` event subscription with `stateChanged` event and check for `Disconnected` state.

**Before**:
```javascript
callObject.on('callEnded', (args) => {
    logger.warning(`Call ended`, { 
        callId: callObject.id,
        reason: args.callEndReason 
    });
    // UI reset logic
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
callObject.on('stateChanged', () => {
    // Handle call disconnected state (replaces callEnded event)
    if (callObject.state === 'Disconnected') {
        logger.warning(`Call disconnected`, { 
            callId: callObject.id,
            endReason: callObject.callEndReason
        });
        // UI reset logic
    }
});
```

### Issue 2: Incoming Call Event Subscription
**Problem**: Similar issue with incoming call `callEnded` event subscription.

**Fix**: Updated incoming call event handling to use `stateChanged` event.

**Before**:
```javascript
incomingCall.on('callEnded', (args) => {
    logger.warning('Incoming call ended', { reason: args.callEndReason });
    // UI reset logic
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
incomingCall.on('stateChanged', () => {
    if (incomingCall.state === 'Disconnected') {
        logger.warning('Incoming call ended/declined', { 
            endReason: incomingCall.callEndReason 
        });
        // UI reset logic
    }
});
```

## Valid Events in ACS JavaScript SDK

### Call Object Events:
- ✅ `stateChanged` - Call state changes (None, Connecting, Connected, Disconnected, etc.)
- ✅ `remoteParticipantsUpdated` - When participants are added/removed
- ✅ `idChanged` - When call ID changes
- ✅ `isMutedChanged` - When mute state changes
- ✅ `isScreenSharingOnChanged` - When screen sharing state changes
- ✅ `isLocalVideoStartedChanged` - When local video state changes
- ❌ `callEnded` - **This event does not exist**

### Call States:
- `None` - Initial state
- `Connecting` - Call is being established
- `Ringing` - Remote participant is being notified
- `Connected` - Call is active
- `Disconnected` - Call has ended
- `LocalHold` - Call on hold locally
- `RemoteHold` - Call on hold remotely

## Testing Results
After the fix:
- ✅ Event subscription errors eliminated
- ✅ Call state changes properly tracked
- ✅ UI updates correctly when calls end
- ✅ Both outbound and incoming calls handled properly
- ✅ No more "unknown event name" errors

## Key Changes Made
1. **Removed** all references to `callEnded` event
2. **Added** proper `stateChanged` event handling with `Disconnected` state check
3. **Consolidated** call end logic into the `stateChanged` handler
4. **Updated** both outbound call and incoming call event subscriptions
5. **Maintained** all UI reset functionality when calls end

## Code Quality Improvements
- More robust error handling
- Consistent logging patterns
- Proper state management
- Better separation of concerns

The web client should now properly handle call events without SDK errors and correctly manage call lifecycle states.
